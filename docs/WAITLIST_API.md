# Waitlist API

`POST /api/waitlist` on the Spread Vercel app (TanStack Start server route) collects beta-tester/interest signups (name and email). Each new signup is appended as a row in the **Spread Beta Waitlist** Google Sheet; the form then emails an alert to **graymattertechllc@gmail.com** through FormSubmit (see *Email alerts*). It stands apart from the product: it needs no account and changes no product data.

The request/response contract is identical across PoryGen, Studigo, APEX, FundMatch and Spread, so one frontend form pattern works for all five.

Implementation: `src/routes/api/waitlist.ts` (server-only route), `src/lib/waitlist.server.ts` (validation, abuse controls, Google Sheets client — no SDK). Tests: `src/lib/waitlist.test.ts`, run by `npm test`.

The waitlist is the only thing that leaves the visitor's device, and only when they submit the form. It never reads or writes the local-first planner, profiles, licensing or backups.

## Frontend contract

Same-origin `fetch` on Vercel. The GitHub Pages mirror is static and has no server, so a form there must post to `https://spread-app-teal.vercel.app/api/waitlist`; `https://wglewis0721.github.io` is allowed by default for that.

```ts
const response = await fetch(`/api/waitlist`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Ada Lovelace',     // optional, shown as a required field in the form
    email: 'ada@example.com', // required
    website: '',              // honeypot: render as a hidden input and leave empty
  }),
});
const result = await response.json();
```

| Field | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | ≤100 chars; trimmed, single line. |
| `email` | string | Required. Trimmed and lowercased. ≤254 chars. |
| `website` | string | Honeypot. Hide it from people (`position:absolute; left:-9999px`, `tabindex="-1"`, `autocomplete="off"`, `aria-hidden="true"`), not with `type="hidden"`. |

**Only name and email are collected.** Any other field a form sends (`product`, `source`, `audience`, `consent`, …) is ignored and never stored, except that `consent: false` is refused. Submitting the form is the opt-in, so put a line under the button such as “We'll email you about the Spread beta. Unsubscribe anytime.”

### Responses

Success, including an email that is already on the list (deliberately identical, so the endpoint can't be used to look people up):

```json
200 { "ok": true, "status": "joined" }
```

Errors are `{ error, code, retryable, field? }`. `error` is safe to show the user; `field` names the input to highlight.

| Status | `code` | `field` | Retryable | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `EMAIL_REQUIRED` | `email` | no | No email. |
| 400 | `INVALID_EMAIL` | `email` | no | Not a plausible email address. |
| 400 | `CONSENT_REQUIRED` | `consent` | no | The form sent `consent: false`. |
| 400 | `INVALID_FIELD` | `name` | no | `name` isn't text. |
| 400 | `INVALID_JSON` / `INVALID_REQUEST` | — | no | Body isn't a JSON object. |
| 403 | `ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED` | — | no | Browser `Origin` isn't this site or the allowlist. |
| 405 | `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` | — | no | Use POST. |
| 413 | `REQUEST_TOO_LARGE` | — | no | Body over 8 KB. |
| 415 | `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` | — | no | Send `application/json`. |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` | — | yes | Too many attempts from one IP; honour `Retry-After` (seconds). |
| 502 | `WAITLIST_STORAGE_FAILED` | — | yes | Saving failed: the Google Sheets call, or (with no sheet configured) the email alert. |
| 503 | `WAITLIST_UNAVAILABLE` | — | yes | Neither the sheet nor email alerts are configured (alerts turned off and no Google credentials). |
| 500 | `WAITLIST_FAILED` | — | yes | Unexpected error. |

Suggested UI: disable the button while the request is in flight; on `ok` show a thank-you state; on a `field` error mark that input; on `retryable` offer a retry.

### Origins and CORS

Same-origin plus `https://wglewis0721.github.io` (the Pages mirror). Add others to `WAITLIST_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Allowed cross-origin callers get `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and a 204 preflight; any other browser origin gets 403. Requests with no `Origin` (curl, server-side) are accepted, since they aren't browser CSRF.

## Spreadsheet

Rows go to the **first tab** of **Spread Beta Waitlist** (in *Gray Matter LLC › 03 - Sales & Clients › Beta Waitlists*), or to the tab named by `WAITLIST_SHEET_TAB`. Row 1 is the header, columns A–E:

```
submitted_at | email | name | consent_version | status
```

- `submitted_at` is ISO-8601 UTC.
- `consent_version` is `WAITLIST_CONSENT_VERSION` in the waitlist module. Bump it when the wording under the form changes.
- `status` starts as `waitlisted`. Change it by hand (`invited`, `active`, `unsubscribed`, …) as you send beta invites; the API never rewrites rows.
- Values are written with `valueInputOption=RAW`, and text starting with `= + - @` gets a leading `'`, so submitted text can't run as a formula in Sheets or in a CSV/Excel export.
- Duplicate check: column B is read before each append. Two simultaneous submits of the same new email can both land; rare and harmless.

## Email alerts

Each signup is also emailed to **graymattertechllc@gmail.com** through FormSubmit, the relay the Gray Matter site's contact form already uses. **The browser sends the alert, not the server:** FormSubmit's Cloudflare protection rejects requests from Vercel's servers (HTTP 403), while browser requests go through, exactly as on the Gray Matter site. After `/api/waitlist` answers `ok`, the form fires this and never waits on it:

```ts
if (result.ok) {
  fetch('https://formsubmit.co/ajax/graymattertechllc@gmail.com', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json', accept: 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      _subject: `[Spread] New beta waitlist signup: ${email}`,
      _template: 'table',
      _captcha: 'false',
      _replyto: email, // replying from Gmail reaches the person
      product: 'Spread',
      name,
      email,
    }),
  }).catch(() => {}); // the signup is already saved; never block or fail the form on the alert
}
```

- The sheet is the record; the alert is a convenience. A blocked or failed alert loses nothing.
- **One-time activation:** FormSubmit holds the first message from a new site and emails an **Activate Form** link to the inbox. Click it once per site (`spread-app-teal.vercel.app`, plus `wglewis0721.github.io` for the Pages mirror).
- The server-side alert in the waitlist module stays available but is switched off with `WAITLIST_NOTIFY_EMAIL=off` in this project's Vercel env vars.

## Setup

One Google service account (`waitlist@waitlist-graymattertechllc.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) serves all five products; it has Editor access to the *Beta Waitlists* folder only.

1. **Google Cloud project** → APIs & Services → enable **Google Sheets API**.
2. IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → **Create service account** (no roles) → Keys → **Add key → JSON**. Keep the file private; never commit it.
3. In Google Drive, **share the *Beta Waitlists* folder** with the service account's `client_email` as **Editor**. Every sheet inside inherits access, and the account can see nothing else in your Drive.
4. Set these server-side variables in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables** (Production and Preview), then redeploy:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` | `client_email` from the JSON key |
   | `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` | `private_key` from the JSON key, as-is with its `\n` sequences |
   | `WAITLIST_SPREADSHEET_ID` | the ID between `/d/` and `/edit` in the **Spread Beta Waitlist** URL |
   | `WAITLIST_SHEET_TAB` | optional; empty = first tab |
   | `WAITLIST_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | optional, comma-separated extra browser origins |
   | `WAITLIST_NOTIFY_EMAIL` | `off` (set) — the browser sends alerts; an address re-enables the server-side alert |

5. Check it:

```sh
curl -sS -X POST https://spread-app-teal.vercel.app/api/waitlist \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","consent":true,"source":"setup-check"}'
```

Expect `{"ok":true,"status":"joined"}` and a new row. `503 WAITLIST_UNAVAILABLE` means a Google variable is missing (and server alerts are off); `502` usually means the folder/sheet isn't shared with the service account, `WAITLIST_SHEET_TAB` names a missing tab, or the Sheets API isn't enabled (the server log shows Google's HTTP status, never the key).

## Abuse controls

- Origin check with an explicit allowlist (above).
- 8 KB body cap, JSON only, strict types; unknown fields are dropped.
- Honeypot `website` field: filled → fake success, nothing stored.
- In-memory limit of 10 attempts per IP per 10 minutes, per warm instance — best-effort only. For a durable limit use a **Vercel Firewall rate-limit rule** on `/api/waitlist`.
- Error responses never include Google responses or credentials.

## Privacy

Waitlist contact details are **deliberately stored** in Google Sheets and emailed from the visitor's browser through FormSubmit to the Gray Matter Gmail inbox (Google and FormSubmit are subprocessors). Only the name, email and signup time are stored; no IP address, user agent or other form fields. Name the waitlist in the privacy policy, and honour removal requests by deleting the row.
